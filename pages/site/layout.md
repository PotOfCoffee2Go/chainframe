## Site Layout







> Most themes and highlighters play nice together, the theme can
override some of the highlighter styles so there are a few combinations that
are not all that visually appealing. The highlighters are directly from the
[highlightjs](//highlightjs.org/) [cloudflare](//www.cloudflare.com/) CDN.
The themes however are in css/mdthemes directory of the server, so can be
modified to play nice with a specific highlighter.

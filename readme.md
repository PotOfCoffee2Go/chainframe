## ChainFrame

ChainFrame is a framework which allows building of [fluent interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface)
to asynchronous and synchronous functions using JavaScript Dot Notation.
No special coding is required when composing functions to make them _chainable_. Arguments to methods in
the chain can be entered as parameters or passed from the return values of the previous method.

See [ChainFrame](http://potofcoffee2go.github.io/chainframe/) site for details.
